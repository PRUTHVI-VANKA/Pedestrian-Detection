A computer vision project to detect pedestrians in images and video using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in OpenCV.

## Features
- Detects pedestrians in static and video input
- Uses HOG descriptors with SVM
- Real-time processing with OpenCV

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV

## How to Run
```bash
python pedestrian_detection.py
